# Recipe Recommendation Project

This project is a recipe recommendation application that utilizes the Edamam API to provide users with personalized recipe suggestions based on their preferences and dietary restrictions.

## Technologies Used

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/)

## About React.js

React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and build efficient, interactive web applications. React.js follows a component-based architecture, making it easier to manage and update different parts of an application. It provides a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) for optimizing rendering performance and supports a declarative syntax, which enhances code readability.

To learn more about React.js, you can refer to the official [React.js documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs).

## About Edamam API

The Edamam API is a powerful tool for accessing a vast collection of recipe data. It provides various endpoints for searching recipes, retrieving recipe details, and filtering recipes based on dietary requirements. With the Edamam API, you can access recipe information such as ingredients, nutrition facts, and cooking instructions.

To learn more about the Edamam API and its capabilities, you can visit the [Edamam Developer Portal](https://developer.edamam.com/).
